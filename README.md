# 👋 Welcome to My Data Projects Repository

Hi there!  
I’m a **Data Engineer and Business Intelligence Specialist** passionate about building modern data solutions — from ingestion pipelines to clear, interactive analytics.

This repository is a **personal workspace** where I collect and document my learning journey, technical experiments, and reusable solutions built across **Power BI**, **Azure**, **Databricks**, and **SQL ecosystems**.

> ⚙️ *The repository is currently being organized — new sections and examples are continuously added.*

## 🚀 About Me

I work on transforming raw data into actionable insights through well-designed data models, automation pipelines, and intuitive reports.  
My daily work revolves around **data orchestration, modeling, and visualization** across both **Azure** and **Power BI** platforms.

I enjoy:
- Designing **ETL/ELT pipelines** with Azure Data Factory  
- Building **dynamic dashboards** in Power BI using advanced DAX logic  
- Exploring **Databricks** for large-scale data processing  
- Integrating **APIs, Key Vaults, and Logic Apps** for cloud automation  
- Documenting my workflows to help others learn more effectively
